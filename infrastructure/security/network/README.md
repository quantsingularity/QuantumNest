# Network Security Configuration for QuantumNest Financial Platform

## Overview
This directory contains comprehensive network security configurations including Kubernetes Network Policies, AWS Security Groups, firewall rules, and network segmentation policies designed for financial services compliance.

## Components
- `kubernetes-network-policies/` - Kubernetes Network Policies for micro-segmentation
- `aws-security-groups/` - AWS Security Group configurations
- `firewall-rules/` - Cloud firewall and WAF configurations
- `network-segmentation/` - Network architecture and segmentation policies
- `monitoring/` - Network monitoring and intrusion detection

## Security Principles
1. **Zero Trust Network**: No implicit trust based on network location
2. **Micro-segmentation**: Fine-grained network controls between services
3. **Defense in Depth**: Multiple layers of network security
4. **Least Privilege**: Minimal required network access
5. **Continuous Monitoring**: Real-time network traffic analysis

## Compliance Standards
- **PCI DSS**: Network segmentation and access controls
- **SOC 2**: Network security monitoring and controls
- **ISO 27001**: Information security network controls
- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Network security controls
